ENV S 193 - Statistics for Environnmental Science, Homework 3, Spring 2025

## General information

This repository is for HW 3 for ENV S 193 DS, Spring 2025. Throughout the course, we have collected personal data. In this assignment, I am using summarizing data collected from family phone calls into visual plots and tables, as well as performing statistical critique on the paper "Environmentally relevant concentrations of polyethylene microplastics negatively impact the survival, growth and emergence of sediment-dwelling invertebrates" by Ziajahromi et. al.

### Packages

Will need:
```
library(tidyverse) # general use
library(here) # file organization
library(janitor) # cleaning data frames
library(gt) # creating tables
library(readxl) # reading excel files
library(scales) # modifying axis labels
library(ggplot) # creating models
```

## Data and file information

File structure:
```
```
All code is in the `code` folder. The code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.
